FileNotFoundError: No such file: '/home/lyt/DiffSynth-Studio/data/drones/The drone slowly ascends while smoothly panning to the right, presenting a breathtaking panoramic view of a vast mountainous landscape. In the immediate foreground, rugged peaks covered in rich reddish-brown and orange autumn foliage are prominent, with a small structure or marker visible on the highest point. Beyond these immediate hills, a deep valley unfolds, revealing a large, winding blue lake nestled between layers of towering mountains. Villages are visible clustered along the lake's shores. The mid-ground mountains are densely forested, appearing dark green and brown, while the distant background features towering, jagged grey mountain ranges fading into a light blue haze, emphasizing the immense scale of the alpine environment. The scene is bathed in bright sunlight under a clear blue sky, highlighting the vibrant fall colors and the serene grandeur of the natural vista.'
